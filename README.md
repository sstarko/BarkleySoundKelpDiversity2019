# BarkleySoundKelpDiversity2019

This is the data and code repository for Starko et al (2019). "Environmental heterogeneity mediates scale-dependent biodiversity loss in intertidal kelp communties." 

Two R scripts are included. One for proportional odds modeling and plotting of ordinal mosaic plots ("Ordinal_regressions.R") and the other for all remaining analyses ("KelpDiversityCode.R")

Raw data is provided in the file "CommunityData_all_raw.xlsx". Other data files are called in the R scripts to run analyses. Figures produced by these scripts are not yet publication ready as text was added and figures were panelled in powerpoint, inkscape and/or photoshop
